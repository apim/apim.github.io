# Spring REST Tutorial

This tutorial covers the aspect of implementing REST based web services using Spring framework. Basic understanding of web services and REST protocol are prerequisites here. Spring's gift to REST server side programming - two annotations `@RequestBody` and `@ResponseBody` will be used in the examples practiced here. On the other hand, for client side REST call, we have `RestTemplate`. These annotations are smart implementations by Spring which can do serialisation and de-serialisation of various request/response types e.g. JSON, XML etc.

Begin by creating a new Maven Java Web project in Eclipse as *spring-rest-tutorial*.
